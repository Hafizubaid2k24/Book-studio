                    <p class="text-gray-700">In Revive Your Heart: Putting Life in Perspective, Nouman Ali Khan extends a heartfelt invitation: to embark on a journey of spiritual revival, guided by the wisdom of the Qur’an reshaped for modern times. Across 252 pages (or about 192–260, depending on the edition) 
Dawah Books
press.ips.org.pk
, this collection of essays gently yet powerfully urges believers to reassess the core of their faith—and their hearts.

The book is thoughtfully divided into five thematic parts 
OPENMAKTABA
:

Connecting to Allah Through Du’a: Starting with “A Prayer for Desperate Times” and “Du’a and Disappointment,” Nouman Ali Khan paints du’a not just as words, but as a lifeline—something deeply personal, yet universally poignant. These chapters reflect on how, in our weakest moments, we may misunderstand Allah’s timing and mercy by confusing delay with denial.

Creating a Cohesive Muslim Community: In chapters like “Criticism,” “Assumptions,” and “Leadership,” he explores how communities fracture—not solely through doctrinal disputes but through everyday behaviors. Khan dismantles destructive patterns—judgment, neglect, false perceptions—and reconstructs them with Qur’anic counsel, highlighting how sincere leadership is measured not by followers, but by character in adversity

About Islam
.

Our Financial Dealings: Our relationship with wealth—how we earn and spend it—is talk of critical reflection. In “How We Earn” and “Money Matters,” the author underscores how ethical financial practices and aligned intentions can transform ordinary transactions into acts of worship.

Some Contemporary Issues: Boldly navigating topics often sidelined in spiritual discourse, chapters such as “It’s a Girl!,” “Thoughts on Paris,” and “The Dangers of Listening to Music” confront cultural biases, global tragedies, and modern temptations head-on, offering clarity rooted in compassion and faith 
OPENMAKTABA
.

Focusing on the Akhirah: Closing with “Putting Life in Perspective,” “Small Beginnings,” and “The Afterlife,” Khan brings us full circle: reminding readers that this world is transient, that every act—no matter how small—matters infinitely, and that the soul’s pulse is never truly restored until directed toward our eternal destination

What makes this work deeply compelling is its accessible style: informal, conversational, and almost like a trusted teacher speaking directly to your heart

. Rooted in Khan’s profound understanding of Arabic, he unpacks even minute linguistic details from the Qur’an—revealing layers of meaning often overlooked in translation

The book is not theory cloaked in academic prose. Instead, it feels like a living dialogue—packed with modern dilemmas, yet anchored in timeless spiritual truths. It challenges the distracted, the discouraged, the distant: “How real is your belief in the afterlife?” “How interconnected are we as a community when blindness of fault clouds brotherhood?” These questions beckon realignment.

Reviews from the Muslim community are overwhelmingly positive. On ProductiveMuslim.com, reviewers prize its clarity and the way it makes Qur’an come alive through everyday relevance

. Another blog writer echoed the sentiment—citing how Khan’s narrative breaks down Qur’anic verses with such elegance that it inspired a deeper love for the Arabic language and the holy text itself

For many, Revive Your Heart comes as a wake-up call. It doesn’t just inform—it nudges, it pierces complacency, urging the spiritual sleeper to awaken. It is a mirror held up to modern lifelines of faith—du’a, how we speak of each other, earn our living, process heartache, think of women, and ultimately prioritize what’s eternal.

Yet the tone remains gentle, humane. Rather than guilt, there is grace; rather than reproach, there is optimism that hearts can—and must—revive. In twenty-first-century Islam, where distraction is constant and identity fragile, this is more than a book—it’s a guide, a companion, a much-needed conversation starter between the soul and its Creator.</p>

First published by Awakening Publications in 2016, this 232-page guide is meticulously divided into three core sections: Spiritual Productivity, Physical Productivity, and Social Productivity 
Islamic Self Help
Kalamullah
.

Faris—an economist turned productivity coach and founder of ProductiveMuslim.com—builds a practical framework designed for the global urban Muslim. His message is clear: Islam equips us with tools like Salah (prayer), fasting, and intention-setting—not merely as rituals but as vital sources of productivity

Kalamullah
. At the heart of the book is the beautifully simple formula: Productivity = Focus × Energy × Time—all channelled towards meaningful, spiritually-aligned goals 
Goodreads
.

Sections & Themes
1. Spiritual Productivity

Faris begins by emphasizing how spiritual practices amplify our productivity. Acts like purposeful intention (niyyah), gratitude (shukr), patience (sabr), and mindfulness (taqwa) generate spiritual energy—a force that transforms ordinary actions into acts of worship 
Goodreads
.
He then explores spiritual time—using time wisely as a stewardship entrusted by Allah, reminding readers of its finite and sacred nature 
Goodreads
.
Finally, spiritual focus calls for clarity of intent. Faris even suggests maintaining an “intention journal” to ensure our aim aligns with divine purpose 
Goodreads
.

2. Physical Productivity

Faris places a strong emphasis on physical well-being as a foundation for productivity. He discusses sleep management (like hygiene, Qur'anic reflections before bed, and power naps), nutrition (seeing food as a blessing and eating with mindfulness), and fitness (incorporating movement and mental exercise into daily life) 
Goodreads
.
He also introduces strategies for defeating distraction—through techniques like “Most Important Task” prioritization, Pomodoro-style focus, routine structuring, and decluttering both physical and mental spaces 
Goodreads

3. Social Productivity

This section expands productivity into relational spaces—how to build social energy through connections with family, community, and service; social time—balancing obligations gracefully; and social focus—engaging sincerely, professionally, and purposefully in shared work 
Goodreads
.

Final Insights

Faris closes with chapters on goal-setting and vision—rooted in purpose and the hereafter. He invites readers to shape balanced, meaningful life goals and align daily habits accordingly
